service.ShowOrderCloseByExample(context.Background(), 123456, 654321)

// Or directly from MT4Account
result, err := mt4.OrderCloseBy(context.Background(), 123456, 654321)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Error closing by opposite: %v", err)
}

fmt.Printf("Closed by opposite: Profit=%.2f, Price=%.5f, Time: %s\n",
    result.GetProfit(),
    result.GetClosePrice(),
    result.GetCloseTime().AsTime().Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05"),
)
```

## üéØ Purpose

Close one position with another opposite-position order. Useful for:

* Trade netting workflows
* Reducing exposure by pairing positions
* Closing multiple positions efficiently

## üß© Notes & Tips

* **Same symbol required:** Both tickets must be for the **same symbol** and opposite directions.
* **Partial overlap:** If lot sizes differ, only the overlapping volume is closed; the larger position remains with the residual volume.
* **Ticket types:** Tickets are `int32` in your API; avoid mixing with `uint64` types used elsewhere.
